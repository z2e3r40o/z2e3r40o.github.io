If you go to your account settings, you will find that you can add a PGP Public Key. Once you add your public key, all emails containing sensitive information will be encrypted for that public key before being sent to you.
I wish more of the sites I use had this feature.</description></item><item><title>hello world</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>This site is a place for me to get some of my thoughts out.
